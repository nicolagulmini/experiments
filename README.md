This repository contains a variety of small and experimental projects that I’ve worked on to explore different technologies, learn new skills, or simply bring an idea to life. 

Here’s a brief overview of the projects included:

- EconoGraph: A simulation project for economic data, designed to model and analyze economic systems and behaviors.
- KarmaGraph: A project that simulates the concept of Karma in a social network, exploring how reputation systems can be modeled and interacted with.
- RemotePyTorchModel: An implementation using PyTorch and FastAPI for a client-server system. The client sends an image of clothing, and the server either queries its cache or uses a model to predict the name of the clothing item. This project also serves as an entry point into caching systems.
- ScrapingGuitars: A web scraping tool designed to extract data about guitars from various online sources for analysis or comparison.
- UninformedRecommenderSystem: A work-in-progress project to implement a recommender system from scratch, without referring to tutorials, to explore recommendation algorithms and techniques.
- tabOpener: A Chrome extension that automatically opens a set of predefined URLs in new tabs, streamlining your browsing experience.

Each project is designed to be standalone and showcases different aspects of programming and technology. Feel free to explore, use, or contribute to these projects!
