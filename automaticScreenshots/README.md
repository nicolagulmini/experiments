# Automatic screenshots on Windows 10

A simple C++ program to take and save (in the default path) a screenshot every 10 minutes in a 1-hour window.

It works on my laptop with Windows 10, so it could be necessary to change the keydb virtual-key codes: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes.

It is also possible to change the time parameters, and if you don't like the animation of the screenshot you can disable on Settings and Display: https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/how-turn-animations-windows-10.
